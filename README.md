# PyAAC
A small TTS made by an AAC user specifically for AAC users, because there isn't much of that on linux

right now, this file will just serve as a more helpful help command than the one implemented. right now all you need to know is that you change voices the same way you do in pyttsx3, so like, /v english-en+f2
